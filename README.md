# Ahk-Scripts

This is a personal project aiming create a comprehensive library of keyboard
shortcuts allowing effective use of all common programs with
only the keyboard.

All scripts are designed to be modular and independent - so that any ahk file can be taken and used on its own. If you publicly release any of these files please link to
or credit to this repository.  

This project will mainly be comprised of autohotkey, however there may be other
technologies added as it progresses.  


# Main features / ideas

One main change I will make is rebinding the <kbd>CAPS</kbd>, <kbd>RightShift</kbd>,
<kbd>RightCtrl</kbd> and <kbd>RightAlt</kbd> keys in certain situations.
Key rebinds will be program and browser tab specific but the <kbd>CAPS</kbd>
key will always be turned off by default.
Ideally I will keep all global shortcuts to some combination using the 
<kbd>WIN</kbd> key, and the majority of custom program specific key combinations
to use the "new" <kbd>CAPS</kbd> modifier key.  

It is only in cases where many shortcuts are required that the right modifier
keys will be remapped.  

Since this project will eventually contain many hundreds of combinations, there
will be a HTML help file showing a map of all shortcuts for each 
sub-project/application which will display all the shortcuts for the current scope.
It will be opened with <kbd>RAlt + /</kbd>, or <kbd>WIN + RAlt + /</kbd> for
global shortcuts.  
These HTML files will be made with [this website project]() I made for this purpose.  

# If you want to contribute

Please feel welcome to contribute to this project, whether it is to add an
existing script of your own or someone else's that you feel would be useful, 
or if you want to improve on one already here.  

Any feature requests and bug reports are also welcome and I will do my best to
maintain this, but please understand this is only a side project for my personal use.
