# Ahk-Scripts

This is a personal project aiming create a comprehensive set of keyboard
shortcuts allowing effective use of all common programs using
only the keyboard.  

All scripts are designed to be modular and independent - so any .ahk file can
be taken and used independently.  
If you publicly release any of these files please link to or credit to this
repository.  


# Main features / ideas

- <kbd>CAPS</kbd> key will become a modifier key, with functions changing
depending on the currently focused program or tab.  
- <kbd>RightShift</kbd>, <kbd>RightCtrl</kbd> and <kbd>RightAlt</kbd> keys will
sometimes be used independently of their left-side counterparts much like the
caps key to offer program scope shortcuts where more are needed.  
- All global level shortcuts will use the <kbd>WIN</kbd> key.  
- There will be help files that can be accessed with <kbd>RAlt + /</kbd>, or
<kbd>WIN + RAlt + /</kbd> for global shortcuts.  
  - These will be created using [this website project](https://github.com/Archie-Adams/keyboard-shortcut-map-maker) I made for this purpose.  
  - The keyboard shortcut to open them should toggle them off as well.  
  - Each situation will have its own help file.  

# Contribution

Contribution to this project is welcome, be it to add an existing script you
think would be useful, or if you want to improve on one already here.  

Any feature requests and bug reports are also welcome and I will try my best to
maintain this project, but please understand this is a side project for personal use.
